# 18 - Explore the Trust Center

In this walkthrough, we will access the Trust Center, Service Trust Portal (STP), and Compliance Manager.

# Task 1: Access the Trust Center

1. In a browser, access the [Microsoft Trust Center compliance offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-home) page.

2. Notice the offerings are grouped into **Global**, **US Government**, **Industry**, and **Regional**.

3. In the **Global** group, click **ISO 27001**. 

    **Note:** The ISO 27001 Information Security Management Standards page is typical of the type of complaince information we provide.

4. Notice there is an overview of the standard; in-scope cloud services; audits, reports and certificates; assessments and reports; FAQs; resources; and white papers. 

5. Browse through any content of interest to you. 

    **Note:** Is there a compliance offering your organization is most interested in?

# Task 2: Access the Service Trust Portal (STP)

1. In a browser, access the [Service Trust Portal (STP)](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com)

2. Notice the **Audit** section. In this section are independent audit reports for different Microsoft's Cloud services.

    **Note:** At this time of this writing, **ISO 27001** related content is accessible via a clickable label. Click the label to open the page displaying ISO 27001 related content. If that is not available, choose another item. 

3. It may take a couple of minutes for all the audits to load. You will need to login to your Microsoft account to view specific reports.

4. If you have time, review any other information that is of interest to you. 

# Task 3: Access the Compliance Manager

1. The Compliance Manager makes it easy to perform risk assessments of Microsoft's cloud services. Use Compliance Manager to manage your organization's compliance activities from implementation to reporting. If you want to try the Compliance Manager you will need to login.

2. Instead, visit the [Compliance Guides](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/Documents/TrustDocuments) page. 

3. If you have time, review any other information that is of interest to you. 

Congratulations! In this walkthrough, you accessed the Trust Center, Service Trust Portal (STP), and Compliance Manager.
