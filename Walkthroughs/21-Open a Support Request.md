# 21 - Open a Support Request


In this walkthrough, we will view available support plan options and then practice creating and monitoring a new support request.

# Task 1: View available support plan options and a technical support request

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Help + support**, then select **Support plans**.

3. Take a few minutes to review the different support plans. Notice what is included in the **Basic** plan. 

4. Click **+ New support request**. The ticket is created based on the values you specify.

    |----|--------|
    | Issue Type| **Technical** |
    | Subscription | **Choose your subscription** |
    | Service | **All services**, **Virtual Machine running Linux** |
    | Resource | **General question** |
    | Summary | **Disk access is very slow for large files** |
    | Problem type | **VM performance**, **Disk throughput is lower than expected** |
    | | |

5. Click **Next: Solutions >>** and read through the recommended solutions.

6. Click **Next: Details >>**. When submitting an actual support request, you would provide as much information as possible to allow for a speedy resolution of the issue. Your contact choices on this page depend on your support plan. 

    **Note:** We will stop at this point. Do you understand how to submit a technical request?

# Task 2: Create a billing support request

    | Setting | Value|

    | Summary | **Monthly charge is not correct** |
    | Select problem type | **Pricing**, **Help me understand when I will be charged** |
    | | |

2. Click **Next: Solutions** and read through the recommended solutions.

3. Click **Next: Details**.  When submitting a real support request you would provide as much information as possible to allow for a speedy resolution of the issue. 

    **Note:** We will stop at this point. Do you understand how to submit a support request?

4. Click **All support requests**. This is where your support requests are shown. An email is also sent to your email address containing details of the support request.

Congratulations! You have viewed the available support plan options and practiced creating and monitoring a new support request.
